Welcome to P'jephphrey B's : Society Simulator IV. The aim of this game is to find a city and grow as much as possible while staying out of debt. To begin the game, a settler is given to you in a random place. If you would like, the settler can be moved using the arrow keys and to make the city, press 'P'. After finding your city, you should give your city a task to build to progress through the game. You can start to build units or buildings, but it is recommended that you begin building a worker to make farms and make the future of your city easy to maintain. After building the worker, you should start to make the worker build farms or trading posts or lumbermills. The lumbermills have to be built on forest tiles. After making the worker, the rest of the game is spent growing the city and making buildings.
